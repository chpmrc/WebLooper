WebLooper
=========

A loop recorder made with Web Audio and WebRTC. Inspired by Boss RC50 and Roland RC505 (used by the great Dub FX).

## Demo

**Note**: Web Audio and WebRTC were still drafts when this application was written. Many functions have been deprecated and I don't have the time to fix things. PRs are *more* than welcome.

Application: http://hackandstack.com/WebLooper/ [Down until deprecation problems are fixed] .
